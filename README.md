## Why use Solona
* Supply Chain Traceability:
    * Implement blockchain to track the entire supply chain of medications, from manufacturer to consumer.
         * This can help users verify the authenticity and origin of their medication, reducing the risk of counterfeit drugs.
* Multi-Language Support:
    * Use blockchain to enable multilingual support. Smart contracts can automatically translate medication information into the user's preferred language, making it accessible to a wider global audience.
* Decentralized Verification: Any centralized system that can go down.
* Allow users and healthcare professionals to validate the accuracy of medication information and warnings.
    * Blockchain can facilitate a decentralized network of validators to cross-verify data.
* Smart Contracts: 
    * Implement smart contracts to send automatic alerts to users when there are recalls, safety warnings, or updates related to their medications.
* Interoperability: 
     * Use blockchain to ensure interoperability with other healthcare systems and electronic health records (EHRs), making it easier for healthcare professionals to access accurate medication information.
* Audit Trails for Regulatory Compliance:
      * Maintain detailed audit trails on the blockchain to demonstrate compliance with healthcare regulations, providing transparency to regulators and partners.
* Store the info using Solana API, so patients can grab the data and read the data straightaway.
* Use Solana to decentralise the information.
* Use Solana because itâ€™s really fast for transactions and also have a proof of history
* Transactions of medicine using smart contracts
* transaction of medicines to be easier through smart contracts for providers and patients
* Proof of history = valuable for provider e.g. metadata
